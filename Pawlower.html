                    Pawlower's inspiration comes from my personal journey with Tako, my dog. Tako has taught me invaluable lessons from
                    unconditional love and the strength of friendship to the responsibility of caring for another life. He has been a
                    constant source of support, helping me navigate stress, anxiety, and loneliness. No matter what happens, no matter
                    who I am or what I go through, Tako is always there for me, unwavering and trustworthy.

                    The meaning of Pawlower's name.

                    The name "Pawlower" is a fusion of two words: "Paw" and "Follower." Together, they form "Pawlower," representing the
                    unique bond between animals and humans. This bond, often unspoken, subtly guides our lives in ways we may not always
                    realize. Pawlower symbolizes how pets are always by our side, leading us through a journey filled with emotions,
                    joy, and unconditional support.

                    Pawlower’s imagery centers around the positive and uplifting connection between pets and their owners. The visuals
                    often feature dogs in natural, joyful settings, capturing moments of calm, comfort, and companionship. The use of
                    soft, calming colors like pastels and earth tones reflects the brand’s focus on mental well-being and tranquility.
                    The overall aesthetic is warm, inviting, and emotional, evoking feelings of happiness, peace, and unconditional
                    love.

                    When designing merchandise for Pawlower, I explored a variety of concepts across different styles. Some designs had
                    a more friendly, approachable feel, while others were more playful and "childish." Many of these concepts didn't
                    make it into the first collection, as they didn’t align with the brand’s desired tone, particularly for the debut
                    release. However, this doesn’t rule out the possibility of these designs being released in the future as side
                    products in the shop.
